Q4.Explain Map, Reducer, filter ?
A4.

Map:- Map calls a provided callback fucntion once for each element in an array, in order, 
      and constructs a new array from the results. callback function is invoked only for 
      indexes of the array which have assigned values( including Undefined)

Filter:- The filter method executes a callback function on each element in an array. 
         The callback function for each of the elements must return either true or false. 
         The returned array is a new array with any elements for which the callback function returns true.

Reducer:- The reduce method iterates through an array and returns a single value.
	  It takes a callback function with two parameters (accumulator, currentValue) as arguments. 
	  On each iteration, accumulator is the value returned by the last iteration, and the currentValue is the current element.
	  Optionally, a second argument can be passed which acts as the initial value of the accumulator.
